# Example Contribution: Simple JavaScript Project

Welcome to the "example-1" contribution in our project's "Contributor's Guide." In this example, we'll walk you through a simple JavaScript project to help you understand the contribution process better.

## Overview

### Objective

The goal of this example is to demonstrate a basic JavaScript project. We'll create a simple web page that displays a greeting message based on the time of day using JavaScript.

### Files and Structure

- `code/` directory contains the JavaScript code files.
- `images/` directory contains images related to the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the example project on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/contibutor-guide-repo.git

2. **Navigate to the "example-1" Directory:**

```bash
   cd contibutor-guide-repo/examples/example-1/
```

3. **Open the HTML File:**

    Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the project in action.

### Example Code
In this section, we'll provide an overview of the key JavaScript code files for this example.


```// Get the current time
const currentTime = new Date();
const hours = currentTime.getHours();

// Select the greeting element
const greetingElement = document.getElementById('greeting');

// Set the greeting message based on the time of day
if (hours < 12) {
  greetingElement.textContent = 'Good morning!';
} else if (hours < 18) {
  greetingElement.textContent = 'Good afternoon!';
} else {
  greetingElement.textContent = 'Good evening!';
}```
